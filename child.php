      Bright, creative kids with learning difficulties may underperform at school. They know they‚Äôre smart but somehow they can‚Äôt quite understand what the teacher is explaining. What is important to understand is that these right brain children often struggle with reading comprehension, math, and executive functioning. It is not because of their ability. It‚Äôs because they are right-brain learners trying to make their way in left-brained classrooms.

These struggles lead to frustration, a loss of confidence, and difficulties in school. Yet all the while, you know you have a bright, creative child.

We help parents end the cycle of frustrations
After working with thousands of students, we know that concerned parents can make a difference by using a strength-based parenting approach to your child reach their full potential.

Strength-based parenting starts with the question ‚ÄúWhat is right with my child?‚Äù It is a parenting style that builds up strengths and assets before it seeks to address problems and weaknesses.

Strength-based parenting is not about ignoring or unrealistically turning a blind eye to the downsides; it‚Äôs about where you place your attention first. When you focus on strengths before weaknesses, you can help your kids use what they‚Äôre good at to overcome their learning difficulties.

How many of these strengths does your child possess?
Here are twelve strengths we often find in the bright right-brain learner. How many does your child demonstrate?

Strengths of right-brain learners

Learns best when they see and experience information
Good problem solver
Creative and comes up with new ways to do things
Observant
High levels of empathy ‚Äì they often relate well to small children animals, older adults
Excellent big picture thinkers
Good at making connections
Strong narrative reasoning
Three-dimensional thinking
Respond well when their questions are answered
Work best when the work is relevant and interesting to them
Able to excel when they are taught in a way that is strength-based and engaging and their challenges are addressed
What challenges is your child facing?

Here are some of the usual learning issues right-brained issues manifest. They become much easier to overcome when you use your child‚Äôs strengths as a launchpad for success.

Difficulty learning and remembering high frequency or sight words ‚Äî that do not generate a picture

Right brain learners can often be quite articulate ‚Äì and clever ‚Äì about the disconnect between what you are saying and what they are thinking.

Some of the things kids say that are often clues about their learning needs (and how clever they may be) include.

I‚Äôm not stubborn‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôm thinking about the picture in my head
I‚Äôm not losing focus‚Ä¶.. I just don‚Äôt understand anything you are saying
I‚Äôm not bossy‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm just telling you the way I would do this
I‚Äôm not lost‚Ä¶ I just found a different way to go
I‚Äôm not mad‚Ä¶. I just don‚Äôt know what words to use when I‚Äôm frustrated
I don‚Äôt know HOW to Do this problem‚Ä¶ BUT I‚Äôm very good at thinking of ways to get away from it
What can you do to help?
Dealing with a learning difference begins with open, non-judgmental communication. Sit down with your child and your spouse and discuss the list of strengths and challenges. Observe your children to identify strengths and weaknesses in their learning styles.

Also, think about the times your child enjoys learning. Do they have specific interests that really excite them, subjects that they just can‚Äôt learn enough about? What do you think made those moments so educational for your child? Was it a hands-on experience giving them items to touch? Was it driven by words or by pictures?

A strength-based approach to education uses your child‚Äôs natural strengths and interests to inspire learning of all types. Such an approach effectively engages children and their successes and enjoyment in turn lowering anxiety and building self-esteem. Best of all, once your child has renewed confidence and new learning strategies, school becomes a place of learning, not frustration.

If you would like to have a conversation on your child‚Äôs strengths, challenges, and how you can make the difference, call us at 561-361-7495 or book a time here.
