      Abuse not only injures the body, mind, and spirit, it is a violation of the teachings of the Savior. Victims of abuse can seek help from their priesthood leader to guide them through the process of healing. “We are all under the Savior’s command to love and care for each other and especially for the weak and defenseless” (Dallin H. Oaks, “Protect the Children,” Ensign, Nov. 2012).    

 
Addiction

Those who have suffered from addictive behaviors have found that their addiction affects all aspects of their life. But recovery is possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ. “For those of you who have fallen prey to any kind of addiction, there is hope because God loves all of His children and because the Atonement of the Lord Jesus Christ makes all things possible” (M. Russell Ballard, “O That Cunning Plan of the Evil One,” Ensign, Nov. 2010). 

 
Communication Issues
Our words and deeds should be filled with kindness, charity, and love. This is true not only for members of our families, but for everyone around us. “With such words, spoken under the influence of the Spirit, tears can be dried, hearts can be healed, lives can be elevated, hope can return, confidence can prevail” (Jeffrey R. Holland, “The Tongue of Angels,” Ensign, May 2007).  

 
Divorce
Divorce is a trial that affects the entire family. Those affected by divorce can receive strength and comfort from the Lord’s promise: “Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. . . . For my yoke is easy, and my burden light” (Matthew 11:28, 30).

 
Grief
Grief is a part of mortality. But because Jesus Christ has suffered the pains and afflictions of all mankind, we do not have to endure it alone. “Though the storm clouds may gather, though the rains may pour down upon us, our knowledge of the gospel and our love of our Heavenly Father and of our Savior will comfort and sustain us and bring joy to our hearts as we walk uprightly and keep the commandments” (Thomas S. Monson, “Be of Good Cheer,” Ensign, May 2009). 




Parenting
Parents who rear their children in the teachings of Jesus Christ can find happiness and fulfillment.  “Parents have a sacred duty to rear their children in love and righteousness” (“The Family: A Proclamation to the World”).  

 
Pornography
Pornography is a toxic counterfeit and misuse of the sacred and powerful God-given gift of human sexuality. Pornography negatively impacts our relationships with God, family, and ourselves. Nonetheless, peace and recovery are possible. “Repent and, if necessary, repent again and again and again and again until you—not the enemy—are in charge of you” (Boyd K. Packer, “How to Survive in Enemy Territory,” Ensign, Nov. 2012).

 
Same-Sex Attraction
The experience of same-sex attraction is a complex reality for many people. The attraction alone is not sinful. While individuals do not choose such attractions, all individuals choose how to respond to them. “Let’s work together on this and find friendship and commonality and brotherhood and sisterhood. It’s important that there be love, and that there be hope” (D. Todd Christofferson, mormonsandgays.org). 

 
Strengthening Marriage           

Couples who have chosen to work through marital problems will find that the Holy Ghost will guide them on their journey. Using the gospel for guidance will not only mend marriages, it will strengthen them to last through eternity. “Marriage is sanctified when it is cherished and honored in holiness. That union is not merely between husband and wife; it embraces a partnership with God” (Russell M. Nelson, “Nurturing Marriage,” Ensign, May 2006).   

Suicide
Although it is wrong to take one's own life, only God can judge such a matter. “Obviously, we do not know the full circumstances surrounding every suicide. Only the Lord knows all the details, and He it is who will judge our actions here on earth” (M. Russell Ballard, “Suicide: Some Things We Know, and Some We Do Not,” Ensign, Nov. 1987).
